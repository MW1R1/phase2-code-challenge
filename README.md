Bot Army Builder
This app allows you to build your own army of bots by selecting from a collection of available bots. You can add, release, and discharge bots as per your requirement.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
Run npm start to start the app.
Usage
Viewing Bot Collection
When you open the app, you will see a collection of all available bots on the screen.
Each bot in the collection is displayed with their name, image, and other relevant details.
Adding a Bot to Your Army
To add a bot to your army, click on the bot you wish to enlist. The selected bot will be displayed in the "Your Bot Army" section.
A bot can be enlisted only once, so you cannot add the same bot twice.
Releasing a Bot from Your Army
If you wish to remove a bot from your army, simply click on the bot in the "Your Bot Army" section. The bot will be removed from your army, but it will still be available in the Bot Collection.
Discharging a Bot Forever
To discharge a bot forever, click on the red "x" button on the bot in the "Your Bot Army" section.
This will delete the bot from the backend as well as from the "Your Bot Army" section on the frontend.
